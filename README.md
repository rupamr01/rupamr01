## 🧭 About Me
I’m a first-year **BCA** student focused on mastering **core programming fundamentals** before touching complex stacks.

I’m fascinated by how **software controls real-world systems** — from microcontrollers and connected devices to flight and space systems.  
No hype, no shortcuts. Just logic, discipline, and long-term vision.

**Beliefs I code by:**
- Strong basics create strong engineers  
- Hardware never forgives weak logic  
- Consistency beats motivation

  <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/python/python-original.svg" width="45"/>
</p>

**Core concepts in focus:**
- Logic building & problem solving  
- Loops, conditions, functions  
- Arrays & strings  
- Modular, readable code  
- Intro to file handling  

---

## 🔭 Interests & Future Domains
These interests guide my learning path and project choices:

- 🤖 **Robotics** — software logic behind sensors, motors, and automation  
- 🌐 **Internet of Things (IoT)** — connected devices, data, and control systems  
- 🚀 **Aerospace & Space Tech** — curiosity about flight software, navigation, and mission systems  
- ⚙️ **Embedded Systems (future goal)** — C/C++ close to hardware  

> Currently learning the **foundations** required to enter these domains the right way.

## 📂 Projects & Practice
> Small projects. Real logic. No filler.

- 🔢 **C Calculator**  
  Arithmetic calculator in C  
  *Focus:* input handling, control flow, clean structure  

- 📊 **Attendance Calculator**  
  Program to calculate attendance percentage and conditions  
  *Focus:* logic and decision-making  

- 🐍 **Python Practice Programs** *(ongoing)*  
  Variables, loops, conditions, beginner logic problems  

More projects will be added as skills mature.

## 🎯 Current Focus
- Strengthening **C and C++ fundamentals**  
- Improving **problem-solving discipline**  
- Using Python for automation and practice  
- Preparing for **Robotics / IoT / Aerospace projects**

## 🧠 Philosophy (How I Think)
> “Trends fade. Fundamentals compound.”

- I respect systems that stood the test of time  
- I don’t rush stacks I don’t understand  
- I believe good engineers are built, not marketed  

Discipline > Motivation  
Depth > Speed  
Logic > Noise  

---

## 🧪 Learning Style
- 📖 Read → ✍️ Implement → 🧠 Break → 🔁 Fix  
- Learn concepts until I can **explain them simply**
- Prefer **low-level clarity** over high-level magic

---

## 🧩 What I’m NOT Doing (Intentionally)
- ❌ Blindly copying GitHub repos  
- ❌ Jumping frameworks without fundamentals  
- ❌ Flexing half-baked skills  

I’m playing a **long game**.

## 🏁 Final Note
> Still learning. Still building. Still dangerous with time.

If you’re here, you’re watching the **early phase**.
The real work is happening quietly.


## 🛤 Roadmap (Next Phase)
- Advanced C (arrays, pointers, file handling)  
- Object-oriented thinking with C++  
- Python for scripting and automation  
- Transition towards embedded and system-level projects
