## 🧭 About Me
I’m a first-year **BCA** student focused on mastering **core programming fundamentals** before touching complex stacks.

I’m fascinated by how **software controls real-world systems** — from microcontrollers and connected devices to flight and space systems.  
No hype, no shortcuts. Just logic, discipline, and long-term vision.

**Beliefs I code by:**
- Strong basics create strong engineers  
- Hardware never forgives weak logic  
- Consistency beats motivation

## 🔭 Interests & Future Domains
These interests guide my learning path and project choices:

- 🤖 **Robotics** — software logic behind sensors, motors, and automation  
- 🌐 **Internet of Things (IoT)** — connected devices, data, and control systems  
- 🚀 **Aerospace & Space Tech** — curiosity about flight software, navigation, and mission systems  
- ⚙️ **Embedded Systems (future goal)** — C/C++ close to hardware  

> Currently learning the **foundations** required to enter these domains the right way.
